My ship is destroyed.††My crew is gone.††I am alone.
This planet's distant sun is so faint it looks little brighter than the other stars in the sky.††It's so cold.
It is inevitable.††I am going to die.

Hope.††It's irrational, illogical, stupid. But my last days alive I will hope for some miracle, if only an easy death.

The sun never sets, it just moves in a circle in the sky over the day.

I remember Alaska and the summer days than never end.†The sun never set.††This is not Alaska, there are no bears.

The ground outside is so dry and lifeless.
The thin air is almost breathable, my suit and Hab can convert it just fine.††Tiny victories.

It's currently the end of summer here. Can you believe it?††Here I am talking to myself.††Again.

The hab provides food thanks to the miracle of the high-yield self-contained hydroponic garden.††Every meal is bland and boring, but I won't starve.
Today I'll eat a protein-infused green mush, but I'm <i>calling</i> it a Super Deluxe Cheeseburger!††Mmmmmmm cheese.
The days are getting colder.††The nights are worse.
The sun is getting lower in the sky each day.

Yesterday I got into an argument with myself.††I'm still mad at me.
There is nothing to do here but keep busy delaying my inevitable death.

This is <i>my</i> planet!††I can name it.††I can rule it.††I am the emperor!
I declare this planet to be named <color=red>Klaxxon-9</color>!††All who oppose this ruling will be denied access to all spa facilities, public parks and well-insulated Habs.
I've decided on Klaxxon-9, homeworld of <i>me</i>, the day has 24 hours.††Days here are actually about 18.4 Earth hours long, but this is my ruling as planet-emperor-ruler-autocrat.


I thought I saw something in the distance, but then it turned out to be...††a rock.††That's what usually happens.
