# Ludum Dare 50 project by David York
The **theme** of this project is **Delay the Inevitable**.

In my game you play as a character crash-landed on a distant planet. The planet is very cold and your resources are very limited. As the days go by the planet gets colder and colder. You explore looking for resources and build up a base with these resources to try and stave off the eventual death by freezing.

The game is made in Unity. External projects that the project heavily leans on are [Ink by Inkle Studios](https://github.com/inkle/ink), a [TMX library](./Assets/Scripts/Hexmap/) which is used to read files from [Tiled](mapeditor.org) which I find simpler to use than SuperTiled2Unity or the built-in Unity tiling system, and an open-source [generic text console](./Assets/Scripts/Console/) I've previously created for other games. Ink is a scripting language used for writing interactive narrative.

This entire project was created by me and is available under the [MIT license](./license.txt) except the fonts (which I did not create but I do have permission to use for this project). This means you have my permission and my blessing to use any of this project's code files (such as C# and Ink files), data files, art, etc. in any project you want in any way you want, commercial or otherwise, without requiring attribution or further permission.
